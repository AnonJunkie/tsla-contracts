Do you want to own a Tesla?

Tsla is an experimental protocol building upon the most exciting innovations in programmable money and governance, employs a fair distribution mechanism that incentivizes key community members to actively take the reins of governance. 

Rather than allocating a portion of the supply to the founding team, TSLA is being distributed in the spirit of YFI: no pre-mine, no founder shares, no VC interests â€” simply equal-opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision-aligned community to steward the future of the protocol and token.
